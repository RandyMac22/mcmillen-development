            <p>My name is Randy McMillen Jr.  I just received my Full Stack Developer certificate from Kingsland University after completing their nine month bootcamp.  The bootcamp was JavaScript focused and extra emphasis was put on the MERN stack.  I have been working on a side project or two for myself while looking for employment.  I'm most comfortable using React.js and Node.js but am willing to learn to use whatever is best to complete assigned tasks.</p>

            <p>I decided to use my nickname from sports to name my development business. I previously attended the University of Phoenix and learned some programming back in 2010, but got out of the field before I got started as I kept getting promoted at Walmart.  I eventually made it to Assistant Manager where I worked mostly overnights most of the 1o years I spent with the company.  The last round of restructuring my position was eliminated, so I decided to go back into programming and chose Kingsland University's program.  The Zero to Blockchain program was exactly what I needed as it refreshed what I knew and added a few things to my toolbox.  I just started the Blockchain portion of the class in February of 2022 and am enjoying learning how things work.  </p>
            <p>My professional life began when I started working for a fire sprinkler company doing purchasing and stocklisting from technical drawings.  I then became a fire sprinkler fitter and worked for the company for 7 years.  I then went to work for Schwan's as a Customer Service Representative.  I worked for them for 2 years driving a truck and selling frozen foods in my assigned area.  I then went to work for Walmart in 2011 and worked for them for 10 years and a couple months, doing everything from remodeling the store, stocking shelves and lastly managing many associates in my assigned areas.
